A collection of folk music, most with harmonies written by Ian Sturdy.

### Note on instrumentation

My instrument of choice is Skip Healy's fantastic 10-hole Special model. Most should be playable on more traditional fifes, but some of the intervals may be off on instruments with poor temperament. I have no idea how these work on the flute, Irish or Boehm.

### Copyright information

Except where specifically noted otherwise, I believe all the original melodies to be in the public domain on account of having been first published before 1922. Where possible, I have worked from original sources to avoid picking up copyrighted alterations, but I can give no guarantee.

My contributions to this music I release under the CC0 license, waiving my copyright claims to the extent permitted by law (see full legal text under LICENSE). I would, nevertheless, appreciate attribution where not excessively inconvenient.
